# UMPIRE (leetcode)

**U**nderstand -> **M**atch -> **P**lan -> **I**mplement -> **R**eview -> **E**valuate

* **Understand (2-3min)** <br/> _"let' me check if i understand the problem correctly"_
  * DO: "can i ask clarifying questions?"
  * DON'T: start coding right away
* **Match (1 min)** <br/> _"this problem reminds me of XYZ pattern"_
  * DO: "i already have seen similar problems before that used XYZ pattern"
  * DON'T: stay silent if you can't match
* **Plan (2-3 min)** <br/> _"my approach would be to..."_
  * DO: "let me outline the steps of my approach before coding"
  * DON'T: to say "let me think about it" and stay silent
* **Implement (10-15 min)** <br/> _"let me write the code..."_
  * DO: "here i'm doing ACTION because of REASON"
  * DON'T: verbose code full of `temp`, `aux`, `var1`, `var2`
* **Review (2-3 min)** <br/> _"let's test the code with an example"_
  * DO: "let me walk through the code with an example input"
  * DON'T: assume the code is correct without testing
* **Evaluate (2-3 min)** <br/> _"let's analyze time and space complexity"_
  * DO: "so the time complexity is O(n) because of XYZ and space is O(1) because of ABC"
  * DON'T: forget to analyze both time and space complexity
